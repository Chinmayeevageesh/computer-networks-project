# computer-networks-project
A Computer Networks project implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a computer
network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes multiple devices
and follows standard networking principles.

## Concepts Used
- LAN and WAN
- IP Addressing
- Subnetting
- Routing
- Switch & Router Configuration
- Packet Tracer Simulation

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking Devices (Routers, Switches, PCs)

## Project Files
- `CN_Project` – Packet Tracer (.pkt) file
- `CN_Report` – Detailed project report => Screenshots and informations are included here

## How to Run
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Load the `.pkt` file from `CN_Project`
3. Start simulation and test connectivity

## Future Enhancements
- VLAN implementation
- Dynamic routing protocols
- Network security features
